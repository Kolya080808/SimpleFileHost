# SimpleFileHost
SimpleFileHost is a lightweight local file-sharing tool written in C++. It lets you send or receive files over Wi-Fi in local network using only a web browser â€” no configuration, no external servers. The program starts a tiny HTTP server, generates a random token URL, and optionally displays an ASCII QR code for phone-to-pc or vice versa transfer.
