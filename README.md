# SimpleFileHost

**SimpleFileHost** is a lightweight local file-sharing tool written in C++.
It lets you send or receive files over Wi-Fi using only a web browser ‚Äî no configuration, no external servers.

The program starts a tiny built-in HTTP server, generates a random token URL, and optionally displays an ASCII QR code (via **libqrencode**) for easy scanning.

## üöÄ Features

- üì¶ Send or receive files and folders locally over Wi-Fi (`send <file/path to file>` or `get <output file>`)
- üîë Random one-time token URL for each transfer
- üßæ ASCII QR code display (optional)
- üß© Archive and split large files into parts (`zip <target> <split_size>`)
- üñ•Ô∏è Built-in minimal POSIX HTTP server **no external libraries**
- üßπ Auto-shutdown the server after transfer completion
- üîí Optional TLS (HTTPS) support via `--tls <cert> <key>`

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation, üõ†Ô∏è Building or ‚ùåRemoving

### ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

Requirements:
- POSIX system (Linux or macOS)
- libarchive (required for archive operations)
- Optional: libqrencode (for QR code display)
- OpenSSL dev libraries (libssl-dev)


This one-liner will help you to install from pre-built binary:

```bash
mkdir temp; cd temp; wget https://github.com/Kolya080808/SimpleFileHost/releases/download/v2.0/release.zip; unzip release.zip; chmod +x install.sh; sudo ./install.sh; cd ../; rm -r temp
```

The install script will ask if you want to install optional QR code support or no.

### üõ†Ô∏è Build from Source

Requirements:
- **C++17**
- **CMake ‚â• 3.10**
- POSIX system (Linux or macOS)
- libarchive (required)
- Optional: libqrencode (for QR code display)
- OpenSSL dev libraries (libssl-dev)

#### Build:

Firstly, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kolya080808/SimpleFileHost.git; cd SimpleFileHost
```

Then start the build script:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh; ./build.sh
```

After doing theese commands, you can delete the folder.

One-liner:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kolya080808/SimpleFileHost.git; cd SimpleFileHost; chmod +x build.sh; ./build.sh
```

After doing this command, you can delete the folder.

The build script will ask if you want to build with QR code support.

### ‚ùå Removing

Uninstall the binary and optionally remove installed dependencies:

```bash
wget https://github.com/Kolya080808/SimpleFileHost/raw/main/remove.sh; chmod +x remove.sh; ./remove.sh; rm remove.sh
```

The script will ask, if you want to delete dependencies.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

To see all available options, run program with `--help` flag:
```bash
$ simplefilehost --help

SimpleFileHost ‚Äî lightweight local file sharing server

Usage:
  simplefilehost [options]

Options:
  --bind <address>        Bind to specific IP address (e.g., 0.0.0.0)
  --auto-bind             Bind to 0.0.0.0 (make server reachable on all interfaces)
  --max-size <bytes>      Limit maximum upload size (e.g., 100MB)
  --verbose               Enable detailed log output to stderr
  --help                  Show this help message and exit
  --version               Show program version and exit
  --tls <cert> <key>      Enable TLS (HTTPS) using the provided certificate and private key files
```

To run the program:

```bash
$ simplefilehost
```

You'll enter an interactive CLI with commands:

### üì§ Commands:

```bash
help
```

The server prints out this help message:
```
Available commands:
  send <file>              ‚Äî Send file over Wi-Fi.
  senddir <dir>            ‚Äî Send entire folder (auto zipped).
  get <output_file>        ‚Äî Receive file from another device.
  zip <target>             ‚Äî Archive.
  help                     ‚Äî Show this help message.
  exit                     ‚Äî Quit program.
```

```bash
send <path_to_file>
```

The server will print a URL (and QR code if enabled).
Open it on another device in the same Wi-Fi/LAN network to download the file.

TLS usage example:
```bash
simplefilehost --tls server.crt server.key
# then in REPL:
send myfile.zip
```

Open the printed URL. If your certificate is self-signed, your browser will warn ‚Äî accept/allow to test.

```bash
get <output_filename>
```

The server will print a URL (and QR code if enabled).
Open it on another device and drag-and-drop a file to send it.

```bash
zip <target>
```

Archives the specified file or directory.

**Examples:**

```bash
zip hello
```

‚Üí Creates `hello.zip`.

```bash
senddir <directory_path>
```

The directory will be archived and automatically shared over HTTP.

```bash
exit
```

Exits program.

As I use WSL, I need to do some more commands in PowerShell. Don't do them, if you don't use WSL.

## üîí Security Notes

- If you use `--auto-bind` the server binds to **all interfaces (0.0.0.0)**. Do **not** use it on untrusted networks.
- Each session has a **random 24-character token** to make guessing the URL unlikely.
- Transfers are plain **HTTP (no TLS)** by default ‚Äî avoid sending confidential files unless you explicitly enable TLS with `--tls` and provide a valid cert/key.
- The server automatically shuts down after a completed upload/download.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Without `--max-size` flag, server automatically limits file size to 200MB
- Minimal HTTP implementation (no keep-alive)
- Large or interrupted uploads may fail (I've tried to fix it, but I am not sure that it works well. At least 60gb worked as it should work).
- If you do not use any bind flags, the server binds 127.0.0.1, to make everything safe. Do not forget to bind to another address.

## P.S.

I've added the project (debian branch) to the [debian mentors](https://mentors.debian.net/package/simplefilehost/). Any help would be great.
